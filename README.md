The Club Membership Management System streamlines college club operations with its combination of SQL database, PHP connection, HTML/CSS/JS front-end, and Tailwind framework design. Students and club administrators can manage club info, memberships, and events easily. This project showcases strong understanding of database and web dev concepts.


#if you want to host the projec then 
Install XAMPP: XAMPP is a software package that includes Apache web server, PHP, and MariaDB database. You can download it from the official website and install it on your computer.

Start the Apache and MariaDB Services: After installing XAMPP, launch the control panel and start the Apache and MariaDB services.

Create a Project Folder: Create a folder for your PHP project in the "htdocs" directory located in the XAMPP installation folder. The default location is usually "C:\xampp\htdocs".

Move Your PHP Project Files: Move your PHP project files to the newly created project folder.

Connect to the Database: Create a database for your project using the MariaDB database provided by XAMPP. You can use the phpMyAdmin tool provided by XAMPP to manage your databases.

Configure Your PHP Scripts: Update your PHP scripts to connect to the database you created in the previous step. Make sure to update the database credentials in your PHP scripts (e.g. host name, username, password, database name).

Test Your Project: Open a web browser and navigate to "http://localhost/your_project_folder" to test your project.
